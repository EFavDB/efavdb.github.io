Overall, our season average was roughly 65%. This is significantly lower than those returned by the bookies this year, whose accuracy overall sat just under 70%. The differences there likely have much to do with information relating to individual players (eg injuries) that would be difficult to take into account in our team-centric modeling approach. It also took us a number of weeks to come up with a solid way of choosing our model&amp;#8217;s hyperparameters. With these issues identified/settled, we anticipate improvements on these numbers next year. We won&amp;#8217;t be modeling the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NBA&lt;/span&gt; playoffs, so this will be our last basketball post for the current season &amp;#8212; we had a&amp;nbsp;blast!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With regards to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MLB&lt;/span&gt;, in our first week, we guessed correctly on 52/93 games, giving 56%. A somewhat poor result, fueled in part by the lackluster Giants. New predictions are up, with better accuracy hoped for this&amp;nbsp;week!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="MLB prediction project, NBA prediction project"></category></entry></feed>
